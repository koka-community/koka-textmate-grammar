# textmate-grammar
This repository contains a copy of the koka VS Code extension's textmate grammar file. We also copy the license from the original [koka repository](https://github.com/koka-lang/koka).

This repository is useful i.e. to provide syntax highlighting within GitHub (via [linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist)).
